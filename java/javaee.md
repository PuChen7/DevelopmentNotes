Servlets are the Java programs that runs on the Java-enabled web server or application server(works on **server-side**). They are used to handle the request obtained from the web server, process the request, produce the response, then send response back to the web server.
##### Execution of Servlets

2. The web server receives the request.
3. The web server passes the request to the corresponding servlet.
4. The servlet processes the request and generate the response in the form of output.
5. The servlet send the response back to the web server.
