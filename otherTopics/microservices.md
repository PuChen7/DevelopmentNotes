Dear Professor Antonio,

My name is Pu Chen. I graduated from Rutgers University in Spring 2018 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
Now I'm working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at State Street Corporation. 

I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from the Principles of Information and Data Management (01:198:336) that I took with you in Fall 2017. 
I enjoyed the way the lectures were presented. It was very organized and helpful for me to learn as much as I can. 
The knowledge I learned from your lectures are being frequently used in my daily work as I need to work on database a lot.
Your efforts in lectures and office hours definitely supported me to get an "B+" for this course.

Now, as I getting more familiar with my work, I'm trying to improve myself by attending graduate school at Rutgers University. 
There are two programs that I'm planning to apply, 
MS in Data Science (Computer Science Department), and Master of Business and Science (MBS) with Analytics concentration.
The reason why I chose Data Science related field is because I'm working on a project called Fax AI at my company. 
As the development going further, I realized that having knowledge in data related fields such as machine learning and AI would greatly support me in developing the software.
And I believe the knowledge in this field will be widely needed in the future.

As part of the prerequisites for acceptance, I have been asked to provide a letter of recommendation. 
Would you be comfortable writing such a letter for me with comments in regard to my coursework?

The deadline for submitting the letter is 10/15/2019. Please let me know if you are unable to provide a letter.

I have attached my class history including grades and assignments. 
I also attached my resume which will bring you up to date about my experience.

I know youâ€™re busy. 
So I would happy to stop by at your office when you have time and provide more information and details to make writing this letter a little easier.
Please let me know your best time I can stop by.

Thanks so much for all you have done for me and for taking the time to review this request.
