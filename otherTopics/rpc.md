# Remote Procedure Call (RPC)

- Remote Procedure Call (RPC) is a powerful technique for constructing distributed, client-server based applications. 
- A remote procedure call is an interprocess communication technique that is used for client-server based applications. 
- A client has a request message that the RPC translates and sends to the server. This request may be a procedure or a function call to a remote server. When the server receives the request, it sends the required response back to the client. The client is blocked while the server is processing the call and only resumed execution after the server is finished.
- The two processes may be on the same system, or they may be on different systems with a network connecting them.

Dear Professor Antonio,

I hope you are well.
I have greatly enjoyed and benefited from the Principles of Information and Data Management (01:198:336) that I took with you in Fall 2017.
I am writing to ask if you would be willing to draft a letter of recommendation in support of my application for the graduate school. 

I graduated from Rutgers University in Spring 2018 with a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Computer Science.
Now I'm working as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at State Street Corporation.
The scope of my duties includes developing trade transaction system for both front-end and back-end, database management, and project migrating etc.
As I getting more familiar with my work, I'm planning to further advance my skills by attending graduate school at Rutgers University.
Since some of my work involves knowledge of data analytics, I chose Data Science related Master Programs. 

Belows are the two Master Programs I am planning to apply at Rutgers University, New Brunswick:
- MS in Data Science (Computer Science Department) - Rutgers University, New Brunswick
- Master of Business and Science Degree (Analytics Concentration) - Rutgers University, New Brunswick

I would greatly appreciate it if you could write a letter of recommendation for me with positive comments in regard to the coursework I took with you.
The deadline of submitting letters for both programs are as follows:
- MS in Data Science (Computer Science Department) - 10/15/2019
- Master of Business and Science Degree (Analytics Concentration) - 12/01/2019

Thank you for your time and efforts.

Best regards,
Pu Chen
